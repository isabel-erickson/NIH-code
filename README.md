# NIH-code

This repository contains code that I wrote while at the Segre lab at the NIH. Most of this code is aimed at data processing, cleaning, and analysis.

## kraken2_processing.Rmd

This file is a Rmarkdown tutorial that I made to help my labmates process standard kraken2 output into a format that would be easy to manipulate using the phyloseq package in R. The lab had not used kraken2 before to classify metagenomic reads and I wanted to provide resources that would facilitate use of kraken2 and of an easy-to-update kraken2 version of the Refseq database that I had created.
